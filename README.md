Introduction
â€‹
We've been working on a scripts "repack" for DayZ Epoch Chernarus and it is now available.

The repack is provided free to all (not just to customers of XstreamGaming) and "as-is". This means we won't be providing customer support for the repack ( I.E Support Tickets). If you have any questions regarding the repack, please post them here. Where we can, we'll try and assist or attempt to fix on a subsequent update.

We have tried to contact all the original authors of the scripts. All those who have responded have given us permission to include their scripts. Thank you to all those who have given permission. For those who haven't responded yet (or we haven't been able to contact); if they refuse permission we will remove their scripts from the package.

The package contains:
DayZ Epoch Chernarus (v 1.0.4.2a) [DayzEpoch.com]
Vehicle Towing [[R3F] Artillery and Logistic by madbull ~R3F~]
Self-Blood-Bag [by Krixes]
DayZ Chernarus Missions [by layzink]
SAR AI [by Sarge]
BluePhoenix Admin Tools [ by BluePhoenix, updated by jasonpointer]
Dual Admin Debug Monitor [by UrbanSkaters]

We have also made a few modifications of our own. These allow people to enable and disable each component as well as set script and Epoch settings in a single file.

If you wish to make changes to the repack, you are free to do so. The only conditions are that you must not attempt to re-sell the resulting package. You must also give credit to the authors of the various components in addition to XstreamGaming for the repack.


Update Schedule
We aim to release a script pack for each stable release of DayZ Epoch (eg 1.0.3.1), not each release. To do this we will generally wait a week after each release to see if an Epoch release looks to be stable.
